# ProjectIdeaDump

A list of ideas to help me develop my software development knowledge, and hopefully produce something useful at the end.

* TV show tracking program.
    * Add a TV show
    * add imdb link?
        * software scraps for season info
    * tick episodes/season i have seen.
    * record sources for the show (torrent/magnet links)
    
* Route generator.
   * Add sections that could be used for a route, for example for running.
   * Add other "stations" for exercise or whatever
   * Include a rating/distance for each of these entries.
   * User enters a desired minimum/maximum distance and rating of stations to do
   * program generates a route to take and some exercise stations.
