# ProjectIdeaDump

A list of ideas to help me develop my software development knowledge, and hopefully produce something useful at the end.

* TV show tracking program.
    * Add a TV show
    * add imdb link?
        * software scraps for season info
    * tick episodes/season i have seen.
    * record sources for the show (torrent/magnet links)
